# rhoReactingCentralFoam
An OpenFOAM solver that combines rhoCentralFoam and rhoReactingFoam for detonation modeling. 

---

This solver was originally created by Caelan Lapointe.

**Note: this solver has gotten a few stars, so I should probably update this here and state that it is a work in progress and I won't get examples and usage up for a little while as it progresses and changes throughout my thesis work (Caelan is usually the one making the changes). I'll probably get docs up and running within a few months.**
